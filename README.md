# About Me

Well, my name is Giovanni Di Salvo, I got my PhD in Mathematics in Oslo in April 2022. It has been a game-changing experience. In particular, working with my co-advisor Erlend Forn√¶ss Wold has been disruptive.
I discovered myself very amused with programming (Python) and Machine Learning/AI.
You can find uploaded here in my GitHub account some projects I worked on.
After the PhD, I immediatly began working as a Software Engineer at Neat, a norwegian based company with employees all around the world. I am embedded in a super stimulating and international environment, with great colleagues. I am learning a lot and, most importantly, I'm having a lot of fun! :)
