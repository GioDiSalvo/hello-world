# hello-world
Just to get confident with github

Well, my name is Giovanni Di Salvo, I'm towards the end of my PhD here in Oslo. It has been a game-changing experience. In particular, working with my co-advisor Erlend Forn√¶ss Wold has been disruptive.
In the meanwhile I got interested in programming (Python) and Machine Learning/AI.
You can find uploaded here in my GitHub account some projects I worked on.
I'm looking forward for stimulating experiences in a company in a new country, now!
